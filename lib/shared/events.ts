// VOLCANO CATS — STRUCTURED GAME EVENTS  (shared FE ⇄ BE)
// ============================================================
// The engine emits these *structured* events; it NEVER produces
// localized strings. The log sidebar, toasts, and card-play
// animations are all rendered from this stream by mapping
// `event.kind` → an i18n template and resolving player ids to names
// on the client. This is what makes the UI fully localizable and
// also prevents information leaks: events reference players/cards by
// id and only include card identities that are public knowledge.
// ============================================================
